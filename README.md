# Note Taker App

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

    An application that utilises express.js to create an application that allows the user to write notes and save them in JSON format on a server, to view old notes again and to delete those notes. The application has both back-end and front-end coding. The back-end handles the api routes and contact with the server and the front-end handles the user interface. I edited the fron-end that was provided to make it look a little more user friendly.
